# The Augmented Reality Ground Plane
A repo for the Augmented Reality Ground Plane!

This tool builds off of the [Unity Experimental Framework](https://immersivecognition.com/unity-experiment-framework/), using ground-mounted video projectors combined with the [Qualisys Motion Capture SDK](https://github.com/qualisys/Qualisys-Unity-SDK) that results in a real time "augmented reality ground plane", where targets are generated on the ground and participants receive real time audio feedback.

To learn more, you can reach out to @trentwirth, the main contributor to this project.
